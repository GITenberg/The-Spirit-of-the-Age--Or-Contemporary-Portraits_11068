description: "The Spirit of the Age (full title The Spirit of the Age: Or, Contemporary\
  \ Portraits) is a collection of character sketches by the early 19th century English\
  \ essayist, literary critic, and social commentator William Hazlitt, portraying\
  \ 25 men, mostly British, whom he believed to represent significant trends in the\
  \ thought, literature, and politics of his time. The subjects include thinkers,\
  \ social reformers, politicians, poets, essayists, and novelists, many of whom Hazlitt\
  \ was personally acquainted with or had encountered. Originally appearing in English\
  \ periodicals, mostly The New Monthly Magazine in 1824, the essays were collected\
  \ with several others written for the purpose and published in book form in 1825.\n\
  The Spirit of the Age was one of Hazlitt's most successful books. It is frequently\
  \ judged to be his masterpiece, even \"the crowning ornament of Hazlitt's career,\
  \ and ... one of the lasting glories of nineteenth-century criticism.\" Hazlitt\
  \ was also a painter and an art critic, yet no artists number among the subjects\
  \ of these essays. His artistic and critical sensibility, however, infused his prose\
  \ style—Hazlitt was later judged to be one of the greatest of English prose stylists\
  \ as well—enabling his appreciation of portrait painting to help him bring his subjects\
  \ to life. His experience as a literary, political, and social critic contributed\
  \ to Hazlitt's solid understanding of his subjects' achievements, and his judgements\
  \ of his contemporaries were later often deemed to have held good after nearly two\
  \ centuries.\nThe Spirit of the Age, despite its essays' uneven quality, has been\
  \ generally agreed to provide \"a vivid panorama of the age\". Yet, missing an introductory\
  \ or concluding chapter, and with few explicit references to any themes, it was\
  \ for long also judged as lacking in coherence and hastily thrown together. More\
  \ recently, critics have found in it a unity of design, with the themes emerging\
  \ gradually, by implication, in the course of the essays and even supported by their\
  \ grouping and presentation.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
